The wind-driven rain load is a key factor in the moisture load on building envelopes. The exposure depends on the climate type by the horizontal undisturbed rain intensity and raindrop distribution, windspeed, wind direction, and on the building specifics such as its direct surroundings, the geometry, and the assessed location on the building (Blocken and Carmeliet, 2004). Usually, the rain exposure ranges between 0 and 1. When considering runoff water or poor detailing and execution such as drainage leaks, a value higher than 1 can be used to implement extra rain related moisture sources in the calculations. Previous studies by Calle (2021) and Vanderschelden (2022) have shown that the exposure to rain has a crucial impact on the hygrothermal behaviour of historic walls in a climate which is warm temperate, fully humid and with warm summers (K&ouml;ppen-Geiger, 2006).</span></p>
