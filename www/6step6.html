    <p style="margin-top: 0px;">Here, the indoor climate parameters are determined. These are crucial for various factors such as energy consumption, indoor air quality, and occupant comfort. The parameters also have an impact on the wetting and drying potential of materials from the inside of the building. Indoor climate, including temperature, relative humidity, and ventilation conditions. It's important to represent conditions that match the building's anticipated use, which might require slightly elevated humidity levels for a conservative approach.</p>
