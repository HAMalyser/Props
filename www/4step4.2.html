  <div class="step4-content">
    <p>The geospatial variability of the response of building envelopes depends on orographic features, urbanization etc. For example, two buildings in a mountainous area, only separated by 10 km, may have a very different hygrothermal response. This may also occur for one building situated in the city centre, compared to another building in the surrounding rural area of the city. In these cases, the climate data need to be specific to the building site. On the other hand, the same two buildings, hundreds of km away, can have a similar behaviour when orographic features are constant over large distances. In all new constructions, existing building and damage or litigation cases, the outdoor climate data should be representative for its geographical location.</p>
