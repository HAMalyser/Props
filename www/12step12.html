    <p style="margin-top: 0px;">Ensure the model reliability by verifying simulation outcomes against real-world conditions.</p>
    <p style ="margin-left: 25px;">For renovation projects, compare simulation results with visual inspections and adjust parameters until they match. If damage appears in situ, fine-tune the model to predict it accurately. Conversely, if the model predicts degradation but no damage is observed, reassess and redesign the model.</p>
    <p style ="margin-left: 25px;">For new construction, it is advised that the user first simulates a similar configuration for which the real behavior is understood as a benchmark to apply the simulation methodology.</p>
