This standard distinguishes between two types of measurements: dry-cup and wet-cup. Dry-cup testing provides information on moisture transport dominated by vapor diffusion, whereas wet-cup testing measures material performance under higher humidity conditions. The latter test involves measuring a combination of vapor and liquid transport when the material pores may be partially filled with water. Liquid transport has a defined influence on the moisture behaviour of porous materials with high water content. This is described by liquid diffusivity or conductivity. These properties are highly dependent on the moisture content and can be determined by measuring water-content profiles using different techniques or approximated using the water absorption coefficient (according to EN ISO 15148) and drying behaviour. The storage function is determined by a combination of sorption test (EN 15271) and pressure plate measurements.</span></p>

When a material is recently produced, usually a list of declared property values can be found in the technical datasheet. The adaptation to these values is explained according to the three ranking levels:</span></p>

A big part of those projects concern heritage renovations. There the buildings&rsquo; original material is mostly unknown and may have degraded or modified over time, making it challenging to determine its characteristics. Additionally, the variability within a single type of material may be very high, mainly due to the origin difference of the raw materials, natural variability of the constituent materials, and different fabrication methods. This material inherent variance makes it much harder to create a representative material for the renovation project. Therefore, in such cases, it is important to determine the impact of the different material properties on the assembly&rsquo;s hygrothermal behaviour using modelling approaches.</span></p>

The approach considers the minor defects in experimental measuring processes and the natural variability within a single material. The variation in each material property is set to the range of an addition and subtraction of the standard deviation to the measured value. For the advanced category an increased limit is considered, i.e., + 2 StDev and -2 StDev. To prevent convergence problems, it is recommended to fit the storage functions for moisture. The Van Genuchten (1980) bimodal and trimodal equations are commonly used for this purpose to fit the moisture retention functions.</span></p>
